# Wind River Linux for Visual Studio Code

## Overview

Wind River Linux for Visual Studio Code is a project for Visual Studio Code published by Wind River.  You may extend it to use Software Development Kits (SDKs) on both Linux and Windows development machines.

These instructions are for a 64-bit Intel image based on the intel-x86-64 board support package.  For instructions on how to use the SDK with the Raspberry Pi 4, please refer to the *bcm-2xxx-rpi4* branch.

## Prerequisities

* Visual Studio Code
* C / C++ Extension
* QEMU (qemu-system-x86_64)
* gdb
* make

## Prerequisities Installtion (Ubuntu)

```bash
apt install qemu qemu-tools
```

In Visual Studio Code install the C++ Plugin.

## Installing the Wind River Linux CD SDK

Download the Intel NUC Software Development Kit (SDK) and Target System Image Full from https://labs.windriver.com/downloads/wrlinux.html .

Uncompress the sdk-intel-x86-64.tar.bz2 and target-full-intel-x86-64.tar.bz2
```
cd $HOME/Downloads
tar -jxvf sdk-intel-x86-64.tar.bz2
tar -jxvf target-full-intel-x86-64.tar.bz2
```

Run the *wrlinux-graphics-10.20.33.0-glibc-x86_64-intel_x86_64-wrlinux-image-full-sdk.sh* shell script to install the SDK to *$HOME/wrlinuxcd/sdk/intel-x86-64*

NOTE: Substitute $HOME for your home directory

```
./wrlinux-graphics-10.20.33.0-glibc-x86_64-intel_x86_64-wrlinux-image-full-sdk.sh

Wind River Linux development SDK installer version 20.33
========================================================
Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/windriver/wrlinux-graphics/20.33): 
You are about to install the SDK to "/opt/windriver/wrlinux-graphics/20.33". Proceed [Y/n]? y
Extracting SDK..............
```

## Setting up VSCode

We now shall clone an example project and configure it to use the SDK.

1. In Visual Studio Code, use CTRL+SHIFT+P to open the command bar.

   ![VSCode command bar](./resources/commandbar.png)

2. Type *Git: Clone* and press enter.

   ![VSCode Git: Clone](./resources/gitclone.png)

3. Select *Clone from GitHub* and press enter.

   ![VSCode Clone from GitHub](./resources/clonefromgithub.png)

4. For the repository type:
   Wind-River/vscode-wrlinux

   ![GitHub Repo](./resources/githubrepo.png)

5. For the destination directory enter: $HOME/wrlinuxcd/

   A subdirectory vscode-wrlinux will be created under the destination directory you enter.

6. In the pane on the left, click the arrow left of .vscode to show the VSCode JSON files.

7. Double-click settings.json to edit the project variables.

8. In the settings.json file, set the wrlinuxsdk.sdkroot variable to the installation path of the SDK.

   ```
   "wrlinuxsdk.sdkroot": "/opt/windriver/wrlinux-graphics/20.33",
   ```

   We must also set the sdkroot in the c_cpp_properties.json to allow IntelliSense code completion to work.   This is a temporary workaround for vscode-cpptools issue #6307.

9. Save the file by choosing *File > Save* from the menu or by using the CTRL+S shortcut.

10. Double-click c_cpp_properties.json to edit the file.

11. In the JSON, set the sdkroot variable to the installation path of the SDK

    ```
    "sdkroot": "/opt/windriver/wrlinux-graphics/20.33"
    ```

12. Save the file.

## Build hello.c

You may now build the hello.c example.  

1. From the menu click on *Terminal > Run Build Task* or use the CTRL+SHIFT+B short cut.

   ![Run Build Task](./resources/runbuildtask.png)

2. In the dialog that appears choose "WRLinux SDK Make" to run the make using the SDK

   ![Build Tasks](./resources/buildtasks.png)

   The make task will be executed and its output will be shown in the Terminal:

   ![Make](./resources/make.png)

An executable file named *hello* should now appear in the project explorer.

## Launch QEMU

1. From the integrated Terminal go to the vscode-wrlinux project directory.
   ```
   cd $HOME/wrlinuxcd/vscode-wrlinux
   ```

2. Execute the following command to create a raw hard disk image:

   ```
   qemu-img create -f raw boot-image-qemu.hddimg 8G
   ```
3. Write the compressed filesystem image from the Target System Image Full to your new hard disk image:
   ```
   zcat $HOME/Downloads/target-full-intel-x86-64/wrlinux-image-full-intel-x86-64.ustart.img.gz | dd of=boot-image-qemu.hddimg conv=notrunc
   ```
4. Copy the OVMF qcow2 image file from the Target System Image Full to your project directory 
   ```
   cp $HOME/Downloads/target-full-intel-x86-64/ovmf.qcow2 .
   ```

5. To launch qemu, choose *Terminal > Run Task* from the menu.

   ![Run Task](./resources/runtask.png)

6. In the dialog choose *Launch QEMU*

   ![Select Build Task](./resources/selecttask.png)

The integrated terminal should now show the output of QEMU.  It will proceed with the boot sequence starting with the GRUB2 bootloader.

![GRUB](./resources/grub.png)

## Add gdbserver

1. You should see a regular Linux boot sequence in the Terminal.  Wait until a login prompt appears:

   ```
   Wind River Linux development 20.33 intel-x86-64 ttyS0

   intel-x86-64 login:
   ```

2. Enter *root* as the username and press enter.

3. Enter *root* as the password and press enter.

4. Run the following command to unlock ostree
   ```
   ostree admin unlock --hotfix
   ```

5. Update the system with newer packages from distro.windriver.com
   ```
   dnf update
   ```

6. Install gdbserver
   ```
   dnf install -y gdbserver
   ```

## Debug an application

1. Run gdbserver with the following command:
   ```
   gdbserver --multi localhost:1234
   ```

2. Wait until you see the message:
   ```
   Listening on port 1234
   ```

3. Switch to the debug mode by clicking on the icon of the bug on the play button on the vertical toolbar on the left-hand side (or use CTRL+SHIFT+D)

   ![Run](./resources/runicon.png)

4. Look for the green triangle in the top-right corner.  Choose *(gdb) Launch)* from the drop-down menu next to the green triangle.

   ![Start Debugging](./resources/startdebugging.png)

5. Click on the green triangle to launch the debugger.

   VSCode will launch GDB and run a series of commands to upload the *hello* executable.  The debugger will stop on the breakpoint placed on main.  Since the first line in main is a call to printf, the source code for stdio2.h is displayed in the editor.

   ![Debug View](./resources/debugview.png)

6. Click the first icon on the debug tool to continue to execute the application.

   ![Debug taskbar](./resources/debugtaskbar.png)


7. In the Terminal view, click the drop-down menu on the right side to choose *Task - Launch QEMU*

8. Observe *Hello World!* mixed with the output from gdbserver.
   ```
   Listening on port 1234
   Remote debugging from host ::ffff:10.0.2.2, port 43400
   Process /var/rootdirs/root/hello created; pid = 380
   Hello World!

   Child exited with status 0
   Remote side has terminated connection.  GDBserver will reopen the connection.
   Listening on port 1234
   ```

9. (OPTIONAL) To terminate the gdbserver from outside QEMU, you may issue the following command:
   ```
   gdb -ex 'target extended-remote localhost:1234' -ex 'monitor exit' -ex 'quit' -ex 'quit'
   ```
